					<p>Our consultants at Europe Control have decades of experience in helping organizations and project teams improve risk planning and management. We design “right-sized” risk processes for our clients that deliver results tailored to the needs of the project/program. We know from long experience that “one size does not fit all” when it comes to implementing these critical processes, tools, and systems. Therefore we work with our clients to help them “get it right”.</p>
					<p>We know that the impact of not “right-sizing” risk management is poor user and organizational adoption and unrealized benefits. Impacts poor risk management can range from overrun budgets, missed end dates, customer dissatisfaction, outright project failure, and impacts to reputation.</p>
					<p>Therefore, we focus on pragmatic risk management solutions that allow management to have more confidence in their project data and reports while reducing project risk while aiming to help you gain the most from these efforts.</p>
					<p>Whether you are interested in implementing some of the elements of Risk Management to augment your existing capabilities or are attempting to implement Risk Management for the first time, we can help. Our consultants have helped clients implement Risk Management, risk oversight frameworks, improve risk management planning and control techniques, and select and implement risk management tool suites.</p>

					<h2 class="h2">Risk Management Approaches</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="shifted shifted--l pt-05">
					<p>After the company's specific risks are identified and the risk management process has been implemented, there are several different strategies companies can take regarding different types of risk:</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="container arr__grid arr__grid--4 pb-1">

					<div class="arr__title">
						<i class="arr__icon"><svg class="icon" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><use xlink:href="#i-arrow"/></svg></i>
						<h3 class="h5">Risk Avoidance</h3>
					</div>
					<p>While the complete elimination of all risk is rarely possible, a risk avoidance strategy is designed to deflect as many threats as possible to avoid the costly and disruptive consequences of a damaging event.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="arr__item arr__item--txt">
					<div class="arr__title">
						<i class="arr__icon"><svg class="icon" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><use xlink:href="#i-arrow"/></svg></i>
						<h3 class="h5">Risk Reduction</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Companies are sometimes able to reduce the amount of damage certain risks can have on company processes. This is achieved by adjusting certain aspects of an overall project plan or company process, or by reducing its scope.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="arr__item arr__item--txt">
					<div class="arr__title">
						<i class="arr__icon"><svg class="icon" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><use xlink:href="#i-arrow"/></svg></i>
						<h3 class="h5">Risk Sharing</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Sometimes, the consequences of risk are shared, or distributed among several of the project's participants or business departments. The risk could also be shared with a third party, such as a vendor or business partner.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="arr__item arr__item--txt">
					<div class="arr__title">
						<i class="arr__icon"><svg class="icon" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><use xlink:href="#i-arrow"/></svg></i>
						<h3 class="h5">Risk Retaining</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Sometimes, companies decide a risk is worth it from a business standpoint, and decide to keep the risk and deal with any potential fallout. Companies will often retain a certain level of risk if a project's anticipated profit is greater than the costs of its potential risk.</p>
