					<p>Russian Business Directory provides business listings for over 20 Million companies in Russia and helps customers easily find business services while at the same time helping local businesses grow and expand.</p>
					<p>Every business directory contains an index of companies listed alphabetically by industry. The individual entries are then often linked to the corresponding company’s website. The business directory helps users search for companies, services, or products in their area in a more targeted way. From the point of view of search engine optimization, an entry in a business directory is important; it makes the website in question easier to find and creates an additional backlink.</p>

					<h3 class="h3">Boost Local SEO</h3>
					<p>With Google’s latest algorithm updates that aim to improve local searches, it’s no secret that the majority of user searches have local intent (examples: “near me”, “closest”, “in [city/town name]”). Local listings will improve organic SEO by building quality links back to your website, in turn improving domain authority.</p>

					<h3 class="h3">More Brand Visibility</h3>
					<p>The concept is simple: The more local directories that list your company information, the more users will be exposed to your business. The most popular listing directories have thousands of daily visitors all looking for a business near them, so it’s essential to have a listing to drive traffic to your website and store.</p>

					<h3 class="h3">Improve Business Reputation</h3>
					<p>Many business owners are afraid of listing their business on directory sites in fear of negative reviews. However, this also hinders users from leaving positive reviews online, which can be crucial to building a reputable reputation. Creating listings on review sites can help you better manage both good and bad reviews.</p>

					<h3 class="h3">Increase Online Presence</h3>
					<p>Many online directories pull company information from other local listing sources, which means if your business is added to the most prominent listing sites, you will soon see your information on other local directories. This additional local listing snowball effect will, in turn, amplify your online presence.</p>

					<h3 class="h3">On-Site User Discovery</h3>
					<p>The most popular local business listing sites — such as Google My Business, Facebook, and Yelp — act as mini search engines for users looking for a particular type of business or service. With your accurate business information added to these key directories, more users will be able to discover your brand.</p>

					<h3 class="h3">Dominate The First Page</h3>
					<p>Imagine your business taking up more real estate on the first page of a local search. Adding your business information to prominent local listing sites can help you capture more organic spots on the first page of Google. These listing sites with your business information will display alongside your website.</p>
