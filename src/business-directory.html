					<p>Russian Business Directory provides business listings for over 20 Million companies in Russia and helps customers easily find business services while at the same time helping local businesses grow and expand.</p>
					<p>Every business directory contains an index of companies listed alphabetically by industry. The individual entries are then often linked to the corresponding company’s website. The business directory helps users search for companies, services, or products in their area in a more targeted way. From the point of view of search engine optimization, an entry in a business directory is important; it makes the website in question easier to find and creates an additional backlink.</p>
					<p class="font-bold">The best online portal that offers trusted, human-edited, and spam-free business listings in Russia.</p>
