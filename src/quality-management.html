				</div>
				<div class="shifted pt-05">
					<p><b>The history of quality can trace its roots back centuries when craftsmen began organizing into unions called guilds. When the Industrial Revolution came, early quality management systems were used as standards that controlled product and process outcomes.</b> As more people had to work together to produce results and production quantities grew, best practices were needed to ensure quality results.</p>
					<p>Eventually, best practices for controlling product and process outcomes were established and documented. These documented best practices turned into standard practices for quality management systems.</p>
					<p>Quality became increasingly important during World War II, for example, when bullets made in one state had to work faudiwith rifles made in another. The armed forces initially inspected virtually every unit of product. To simplify the process without sacrificing safety, the military began to use quality techniques of sampling for inspection, aided by the publication of military-specification standards and training courses in Walter Shewhart's statistical process control techniques.</p>
					<p>The importance of quality only grew after the war. The Japanese enjoyed a quality revolution, improving their reputation for shoddy exports by fully embracing the input of American thinkers like Joseph M. Juran and W. Edwards Deming and shifting focus from inspection to improving all organization processes through the people who used them. By the 1970s, the U.S. industrial sectors, such as electronics and automobiles, had been broadsided by Japan's high-quality competition.</p>

					<h2 class="strong">How do you Manage the Quality of your Services?</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="shifted pt-05">
					<p>Companies often introduce new products to maintain competitiveness. However, it is the service quality and the resulting customer satisfaction that are decisive for long-term business success. <b>We at Europe Control support industries with high-quality requirements in the implementation of tailor-made solutions to continuously monitor and improve the quality of services.</b> Our mission is to make data and information tangible, to close the gap between analysis and action, and to achieve continuous improvement in day-to-day business. The key element is our in-house developed EUROPE CONTROL Real-Time Performance Management Suite.</p>
					<p>Service quality management encompasses a variety of procedures to assess the quality of services according to customer expectations. It also includes the maintenance and long-term monitoring of all services offered to customers, to track developments in quality and measure the efficiency of improvement efforts. By measuring the size of the gap between expectations and reality, companies are delivered with actionable insights for targeted improvements. Moreover, companies profit from the additional benefit of getting to know their target audiences much better along the way. Lastly, continuous service quality management enables companies to identify and reduce sources of errors and customer complaints.</p>
					<p>Unlike measuring product quality, determining the concrete value of services is less based on tangible facts. If a product breaks, thereâ€™s an indisputable problem with its construction. The quality of services, however, can only truly be determined by analyzing a substantial amount of customer opinions over time, enabling the establishment of correlations and overlapping trends.</p>
					<p>To therefore measure service quality in a way that will produce actionable and meaningful results, companies require a continuous source of specific information describing individual service interactions. This enables the specific analysis of individual customer service touchpoints and provides companies with the data they need to make targeted improvements in the areas that matter most to customers. All of this and more can be achieved with a Service Quality Management System.</p>
