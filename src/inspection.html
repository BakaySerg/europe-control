							<h3 class="h3">Why is Quality Important?</h3>
						</div>
						<p>Quality control has repeatedly proven to be one of the biggest cost detriments to internationally sourced products. In Russia alone, retailers annually receive more than $200 billion in merchandise returns, mostly due to issues with product quality. These returns add up quickly with industry-standard return postage and refund costs. With the ease of company contact, fast shipping, and the speed of online reviews, a single bad shipment can quickly cripple a company’s finances and reputation.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="paragraph__item">
						<div class="paragraph__title">
							<h3 class="h3">Quality Control</h3>
						</div>
						<p>Especially with so many products manufactured in foreign countries with such a wide variety of work environments and quality standards! Rectifying this is often complicated and expensive when dealing with contracted testers who don’t necessarily share your company’s vision for high-quality products. Finding foreign testers focused on high returns can be challenging and costly. We aim to make this process simple and inexpensive for you and your business.</p>

							<h3 class="h3">Product Inspection</h3>
						</div>
						<p>We offer a variety of product inspection services including initial production inspections, during production inspections, pre-shipment inspections, and container loading checks. Our holistic inspection process uses these four phases to ensure your product’s quality from the first item on the production line to the last box on the shipping container.</p>

						</div>
						<p>Having a reliable and reputable supplier is vital to a successful supply chain. While there are many suppliers across our client countries, it can be challenging to find one that has the consistency and reputation you desire. Our audit process uses a three-step process to verify their qualities as a producer.</p>

							<h3 class="h3">Food Inspection</h3>
						</div>
						<p>Our food inspection services will ensure that any fresh produce from our clients is contaminant-fee and completely safe for consumption. We provide inspection services that are specifically tailored to the production of fresh fruits and vegetables, cereals, nuts, grains, corn, beans, seafood, meat, and poultry. We also ensure that your products are stored in a protective environment during the inspection so that they remain unspoiled throughout the process.</p>
