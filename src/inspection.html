					<p>Are you looking to minimize the quality risk of imported products? Is your product quality variance too high? Do you think that you are spending too much on your quality control program? <b>Europe Control’s diverse range of inspection services can provide trusted support for your products, projects, and processes.</b></p>
					<p>Independent third-party inspections help clients around the world protect their financial, branding, and legal interests throughout the entire supply chain - from raw materials and finished goods to plant facilities and assets. We offer inspection services to manufacturers, retailers, traders, plant operators, governments, and other buyers and sellers of materials and products in the world’s markets.</p>
					<p>Inspections help minimize the risk of defective products by ensuring they meet both customer standards and industry and government regulations. This serves to protect your business interests, help manage your risk and ensure quality products are manufactured and delivered to their final destination at the specifications of the customer.</p>
					<p>Experienced inspectors help identify products and shipments which may contain non-standard or non-compliant components and materials. Products and materials that we routinely test and inspect include consumer goods such as clothes, toys, cosmetics, and food, to high-value bulk commodity cargoes such as agricultural products, crude oil, chemicals, and refined petroleum products during critical transportation, custody transfer, and storage operations.</p>
					<p class="font-bold">We also support the life management of plant facilities such as power plants and oil refineries with inspection and testing, ensuring that your assets are operating safely and reliably.</p>
