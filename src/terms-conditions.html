						<h2 class="h2_5">Acceptance of Terms</h2>
						<p>EuropeControl and its affiliates welcome you to our Site! The “Site” means our websites and online platforms and services and any mobile or localized versions and related subdomains, in whatever format they may be offered now or in the future. EuropeControl may make information, data, text, software, music, sound, photos, graphics, videos, messages, tags, interactive features or other materials available through the Site and references to “Site” include Content unless otherwise specified.</p>
						<p>By using or accessing any part of the Site, you are agreeing to these Website Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy and all other policies or notices posted by us on the Site. Portions of the Site may be accompanied by additional terms which apply to specific features or areas of the Site. Those additional terms supplement these Terms with respect to your use of those features or areas. These Terms may change over time, so whenever you visit or use this Site, you agree to the version of these Terms then posted. If you don’t agree to these Terms, don’t use the Site.</p>
						<p>EuropeControl also offers a proprietary cloud service and related applications. Use of the Collibra Service and provision of related services by EuropeControl are subject to separate terms, such as our Master Cloud Agreement, and these Terms do not apply to your use of the EuropeControl or receipt of related services, except where otherwise noted.</p>
						<h2 class="h2_5">Permission to Use the Site</h2>
						<p>You have our permission to use the Site, but only if:</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>you are at least 16 years old;</li>
							<li>you are using the Site for informational and internal business purposes (personally or on behalf of your company);</li>
							<li>you follow all the rules and restrictions we’ve spelled out in these Terms.</li>
						</ul>
						<h2 class="h2_5">Accounts; Passwords; Security</h2>
						<p>You will need to set up an account in order to use parts of the Site. When setting up your account, you must give us accurate and complete information. This means you cannot set up an account using someone else’s name or contact information, or a phony name or phony contact information. You have complete responsibility for your account and everything that happens on your account. This means you need to be careful with your password. If you find out that someone is using your account without your permission, you must let us know immediately. You may not transfer your account to someone else or use someone else’s account without their permission. We are not liable for any damages or losses caused by someone using your account without your permission. However, if we (or anyone else) suffer any damage due to the unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable.</p>
						<h2 class="h2_5">User Content</h2>
						<p>By “User Content,” we mean any Content a user posts to the Site. You are solely responsible for any User Content you post to the Site (including on Collibra Community and Data Citizens) and the consequences of posting or publishing it. When we say “post”, we include posting, uploading, sharing, submitting or otherwise providing User Content in any manner in connection with the Site.</p>
						<h2 class="h2_5">Intellectual Property Rights in User Content</h2>
						<p>If you post User Content, you are making a guarantee to us that you either own all the User Content you are posting or you have the right to post the User Content. Furthermore, you are guaranteeing that you have the right to allow us to make your User Content available for others to view and use as part of the Site without requiring that any such use be subject to additional obligations or terms. If you do not have these rights, do not post your User Content. By posting your User Content, you do not lose any ownership rights you may have to it. However, you do grant us and each user of the Site a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, fully-paid, sublicensable (through multiple tiers) and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, prepare derivative works of, publicly display and perform and otherwise exploit your User
						Content, in any media formats or in tangible form and through any media channels now known or hereinafter developed. In addition, you waive any rights of publicity and privacy you have in posted User Content.</p>
						<h2 class="h2_5">We Are Not Responsible for User Content</h2>

User Content comes from a variety of sources, and we make no promises about the reliability of any source or the accuracy, usefulness, safety or intellectual property rights of any User Content. You may be offended by User Content that you see on the Site. You may find some of it to be inaccurate, indecent or objectionable. However, as further set forth below, you agree not to hold us responsible in any way for your use of the Site, including your exposure to User Content.</p>
						<p>In addition, we are not a content-archiving service. We do not promise to store or make available on the Site any User Content that you post, or any other Content, for any length of time. You are solely responsible for keeping back-ups of everything you post on the Site.</p>
