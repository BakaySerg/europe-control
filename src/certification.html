							<p><b>Financial statements, often prepared by a Europe Control, serve as the starting point of a valuation.</b> The Europe Control who prepares these statements is probably the best person to assess whether the business meets the going concern assumption, based not just on the financial statements but also on their personal knowledge of the owner’s role in the business. The going concern assumption is a decision the valuation specialist must make as to whether or not the business can continue to function in the future.</p>
							<p>Intimate knowledge of the operations, gained in conversations over tax preparation, will allow the Europe Control to present an honest business valuation, including the likelihood that the business will fare better or worse without the current owner's stewardship.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="shifted pt-05">
					<p>The central role that the concept of making available plays in Union harmonization legislation is related to the fact that all economic operators in the supply chain have traceability obligations and need to have an active role in ensuring that only compliant products circulate on the Union market.</p>
					<p>The traceability requirements allow tracing the history of the product and support market surveillance. It allows market surveillance authorities to find the liable economic operators and obtain evidence of product compliance. The traceability requirements include labeling the product and identifying the economic operators in the distribution chain.</p>
					<p><b>Accreditation is the independent evaluation of certification bodies against recognized standards to ensure their impartiality, competence, and consistency.</b> Regulators are increasingly relying on independent third-party declarations of compliance to support their enforcement and monitoring activities as they demonstrate compliance with legislation and performance against industry benchmarks and performance indicators. As major procurers of goods and services, Governments also rely on accredited certification to inform their buying decisions, as it provides confidence that suppliers have appropriate controls in place to deliver to requirements.</p>
					<p>Europe Control’s experienced professionals provide client support options ranging from an oral discussion of a reasonable range of values to a comprehensive, fully documented written report that would be defensible in court or with the IRS. Our reports are written so that non-valuation professionals can understand them.</p>
