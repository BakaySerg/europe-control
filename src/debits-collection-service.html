					<p class="font-bold">A debt collection service is usually provided by a private DCA (Debt Collection Agency). Such a package includes various collection methods and solutions for successful debt recovery.</p>
					<p>Debt collection service as a definition is used by a recovery agency totoHow retrieve bad debts or delinquent amounts owed to DCA's clients (creditors) by consumers (debtors). A debt collection service is used when the creditor has tried to recover defaults on their own (usually using their own internal debt collection department) but without success. Typically, creditors will then turn to a professional DCA, requesting a specialized debt collection service package.</p>
					<p>If the debt recovery operation procedure provided by the agency is successful, this will generate a positive cash flow in the creditor's finance system, which will lead to monetary profit for the lender. A debt collection agency offers not only quality debt recovery services, but also to preserve the good name of the creditor's company. The debt collection service package is usually implemented for payment from the lender, but a DCA can choose to collect its interest from the debtor instead, as it depends fully on the agency's policy and T&C.</p>
