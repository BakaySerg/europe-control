					<p class="font-bold">The public access to the Europe Control's 'LIVE' databases provided by this site is a means by which the public can search for and view data held by the Europe Control on companies registered in the State. Customers can also request documents and reports to be returned to them by email.</p>
					<p>When your request has been successfully processed, a confirmation receipt will be returned. This confirmation includes a receipt number that can be used in any queries to the Europe Control about such requests.</p>
					<p>Clicking on the company number hyperlink for the company will display a list of submissions filed by that company. Select a submission or number of submission(s) and then click on the 'Request' then ‘purchase’ buttons, and the Payment Authorisation page will be displayed. <br> Before the Europe Control will process requests for documents it is first necessary to choose how these documents will be returned and secondly the method of payment. Payment can be made from a customer account by entering an account ID and PIN or by credit/laser card. A customer reference is taken also to allow the customer to track his/her requests. Entering all this information will ensure that requests are processed.</p>
					<p>Please ensure that you fill in details in all 6 fields (Address 1, Address 2, City, Postcode, Country, and Phone Number) to avoid errors and proceed with payment. The input of some special characters into the fields will cause errors and prevent the credit card entry screen from loading, for instance, the phone number field does not accept brackets “(“ “)”. Any non-alphabetic/non-numeric characters apart from quotes and hyphens for the addresses should be avoided.</p>
