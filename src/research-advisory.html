					<p>Business-to-business transactions are those that involve the sale of one company’s product or service to another company. The B2B market is large and surpasses the size of the consumer market. The business-to-business market differs in significant ways from business-to-consumer research. Products are traded differently, and there are many dissimilarities between B2B and B2C markets. B2B Market Research, therefore, requires a unique approach.</p>

					<p>B2B buyers behave differently today, and this is part of the reason why B2B market research is necessary.
