						<p>We ensure that the quality and safety regulations of an importing country are met, thereby protecting consumers and the environment while at the same time building a business’s reputation. Our commitment to our clients is clear. We issue a Certificate of Conformity (COC) as quickly as possible to guarantee the quality and safety of a shipment and ensure its smooth clearance through customs.</p>
						<p>We assess conformity before a shipment sets sail, from diligent verification of documentation and sample collection for laboratory analysis to physical inspections of goods.</p>
						<p><b>Once conformity is established, we issue the Certificate of Conformity mandated by the government of the importing country.</b> This certificate prevents the shipment from being rejected and allows importers to clear their goods.</p>
