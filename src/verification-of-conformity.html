						<p>We ensure that the quality and safety regulations of an importing country are met, thereby protecting consumers and the environment while at the same time building a business’s reputation. Our commitment to our clients is clear. We issue a Certificate of Conformity (COC) as quickly as possible to guarantee the quality and safety of a shipment and ensure its smooth clearance through customs.</p>
						<p>We assess conformity before a shipment sets sail, from diligent verification of documentation and sample collection for laboratory analysis to physical inspections of goods.</p>
						<p><b>Once conformity is established, we issue the Certificate of Conformity mandated by the government of the importing country.</b> This certificate prevents the shipment from being rejected and allows importers to clear their goods.</p>

							<p><b>The Verification of Conformity service involves checking the conformity of goods according to national standards or an international equivalent.</b> At the same time, it encourages importers and exporters to understand the need for compliance and its benefits. For ad hoc or first-time shipments, importers go through the basic shipment process: documentary evidence is required to prove compliance with the required standards, or the goods can be tested in an approved laboratory.</p>
							<p>The shipment will be subjected to physical verification to ensure that the documents match the products and that no deviations are found. Regular shipments can be treated under registration or licensing.</p>
